Project Summary: 

A Dice Game Called "HOG". This was a class project apart of CIS61, Object Oriented Programming.
We were provided with a GUI as the framework of our project, but that game's inner mechanics were left for us to code.
Mechanics include dice rolls, point/player tracking, special rules, and developing strategies.

A Critical part of this project was developing a strategy/ computer player to go against. Through evaluation of the games mechanics, 
I developed a strategy that took the optimal move each turn. My final strategy had a win rate of 60%.


Game Conditions:
- Each player takes turns rolling 0-10 dice.
- A Dice's side == points.
- First player to reach 100 points wins.

Rules:
- Sow Sad: If a player rolls a dice and lands on 1, the entire roll gains only 1 point.
- Free Bacon: A Player can roll 0 dice, and receive the single highest digit of the opponent's score.
- Swine Swap: If an opponent's score is exactly double of yours, points swap.
