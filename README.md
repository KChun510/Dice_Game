We were provided with a GUI as the framework of our project, but that games inner mechanics was left for us to code.

A Critical part of this prject was devloping a strategy/ computer player to go agaisnt. Through deep avaluation of the game mechanics, 
I developed a stratehy that took the optimal move. My final stragegy had a win rate of 60%.
